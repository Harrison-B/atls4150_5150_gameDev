Started off with the branch of Professor Bethancourt's breakout clone, adding everything we did in class. This included:
- Ability for the player to shoot projectiles
- A new projectile type for enemies that uses the same projectile script but with an added variable to control direction, and uses tags and triggers for collision detection. This also helps make sure the projectiles do not collide with each other.
- Use a Sin wave to move the enemies gradually from side to side. 
- A health bar using UI elements
